# protein_binding_DNA_classification
in this Notebook we are classifying the DNA sequences, here we are predicting whether the DNA sequence will get bounded by protein or not
## Goal 
1. we have to make a model based on training data set which will predict that whether the provided DNA sequence will bind to the protein or not
2. discover the small motif which is binding site for the protein within the sequences which are bound to the protein
## workflow
1. Data Curration
   1. traing dataset
   2. validation dataset
   3. testing dataset
2. Bulding Architecture and train model
   1. here we implemented 1D CNN which will eventually catch the pattern in the DNA sequence and that pattern will function as a motif.
   2. 1D CNN will get trained accordingly
4. Evaluate
5. interprete
